# The Perils of Language Elitism

Growing up in an Indian culture that strongly advocated the necessity to possess an expertise in the English language
, I valued counterparts with prowess in the language equalling or exceeding my own. By "valued", I mean that I tended
to bond better with these peers, since the eloquent use of language allowed us to express ourselves in the most
accurate way possible, thereby enriching the conversations we had (especially when it came to intellectual
discussions). I came to correlate language skills with intellect and I'm not proud to say it, but I held a certain
disdain for those whose communication held basic grammatical and syntactical errors.
