# Serverless Architecture

- Also known as serverless computing or Function as a Service (FaaS)
- Server infra is hosted by a third-party service (similar to PaaS)
- App is broken down into individual autonomous functions that can be invoked and scaled individually
- Event-driven cloud computing execution model
- Cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers
- Serverless applications run in stateless compute containers that are event-triggered and ephemeral (may last only
  one invocation)
- Pricing is based on the number of executions rather than pre-purchased compute capacity.

Services offered: IBM OpenWhisk, AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions
