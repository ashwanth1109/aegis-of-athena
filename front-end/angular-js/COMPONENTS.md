# Components

A Component is a special kind of directive that uses a simpler configuration which is suitable for a component-based application structure.

- simpler configuration than plain directives
- promote sane defaults and best practices
- optimized for component-based architecture
- writing component directives will make it easier to upgrade to Angular
