# Shell Scripting by Jason Cannon

Script - a command line program that contains a series of commands which is then executed by an intepreter (shell in this case). Great at automating tasks.

Shebang: indicate the script to use "something" as the intepreter

If you want bash as the intepreter

```sh
#!/bin/bash
```

If you want zsh as the intepreter

```sh
#!/bin/zsh
```
