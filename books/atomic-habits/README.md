# Atomic Habits: An Easy and Proven Way to Build Good Habits and Break Bad Ones

## James Clear

> Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results

### Chapter 1: Atomic Habits

Atomic: an extremely small amount of a thing. The single irreducible unit of a larger system.

Habit: a routine or practice performed regularly; an automatic response to a specific situation

#### Small Improvements and Breakthrough Moments

Making small improvements (1% even) on a daily basis can be far more meaningful than big inconsistent improvements. Compounded, it amounts to 37 times better than you started in a year. Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.

Progress plateaus as you make small improvements (Plateau of Latent Potential), resulting in breakthrough moments which are nothing but the result of many previous actions which have built up the potential required to unleash a drastic change. This drastic change is what people see as overnight success, when your efforts have reached a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance.

#### Focus on systems and not goals

Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.

Why systems and not goals?

- Winners and losers have the same goals. The difference is winners implement a system of continuous small improvements that achieve a different outcome.
- Achieving a goal is only a momentary change. If you achieve a goal without establishing a system, you are treating a symptom without addressing the cause. For example, if you clean your room as opposed to a system of keeping things in order. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.
- Goals restrict your happiness. The assumption is, only when you achieve a goal will you be happy. A systems-first mentality makes you fall in love with the process and you dont have to wait to be happy.
- The purpose of goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. When you achieve a goal, you lose the need to push forward. With a system, it is about a cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement.

> It is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress. You do not rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems.
