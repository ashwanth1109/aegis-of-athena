### Chapter 2: The Habit-Identity Relationship

> Identity was originally derived from the Latin words essentitas, which means being, and identidem which means repeatedly. Your identity literally means 'your repeated beingness'.

Through motivation, habits like exercise, meditation, journalling and cooking are reasonable for a day or two before they become a hassle. Changing our habits is challenging for two reasons:

- We try to change the wrong thing
- We try to change them the wrong way

#### Three Layers of change

- Changing your outcomes
- Changing your process
- Changing your Identity

Most people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what they want to achieve, leading to outcome based habits. The alternative is to build identity based habits. So, we start by focusing on who we wish to become and what we believe ourselves to be.

#### The identity layer of change

Behind every system of actions are a system of beliefs. These set of beliefs anbd assumptions that shape the system constitute the identity of the system. Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last.

The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes a part of your identity. It's one thing to say that I am the type of person who wants this. It's a totally different thing to say I'm the type of person who is this. Once your pride gets involved, you'll fight tooth and nail top maintain your habits.

True behavior change is identity change. You might start a habit because of motivation, but the only reason you will stick with one is that it becomes a part of your identity. The goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to become a musician.

When your behavior and your identity are aligned, you are no longer pursuing behavior change. You are simply acting like the person you already believe yourself to be. There is internal pressure to maintain your self image and behave in a way that is consistent with your beliefs. You find whatever way you can to avoid contradicting yourself.

#### Changing your identity

Your habits are how you embody your identity. When you train each day, you embody the identity of an athletic person. The more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behavior. The more evidence you have for a belief, the more strongly you will believe it. This is a gradual evolution.

> When I began my writing career, I published a new article twice a week for the first few years. As the evidence grew, so did my identity as a writer. I didn't start out as a writer. I became one through my habits. - James Clear

Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity. This is one reason why meaningful change does not require radical change. Small habits can provide evidence of a new identity. Each habit occurrence not only gets results but also teaches you to trust yourself to accomplish these things. With evidence, you believe in your new identity.

#### The two step process

- Decide the type of person you want to be
- Prove it to yourself with small wins

Ask yourself, who is the type of person who can get the outcome I want? Once you have a handle on the type of person you want to be, you can begin taking small steps to reinforce your desired identity. Thereby, you have created feedback loops where your habits shape your identity, and your identity shapes your habits.

The first step is not what or how, but who. You need to know who you want to be. You have the power to change your beliefs about yourself. Your identity is not set in stone. Ultimately, your habits matter, because they help you become the type of person you wish to be. They are the channel through which you develop your deepest beliefs about yourself. Quite literally, you become your habits.
