"There has to be another way. I cannot kill those of my kin."

"You know we don't have a choice right."

"There's always a choice, Marcus." I only half believe my own words. "We have an opportunity to speak to the leader of the Aeolians. It doesn't have to be this way."

"It is too late for that and you know it. Things didn't work out the last time we tried."

"No. No. No." I hang my head low. I can hear my own breathing. Adrenaline is coursing through my veins as my killer instincts kick into 5th gear. My body is ready for this, but my mind isn't. In fact, I know how much I revel in bloodshed. But it was never the blood of my kind. Perhaps it is my shame in how prepared I am for this that's causing me pause. I am scared of what I will become once the deed is done. When the first head rolls with one clean swipe of my sword, I'm not sure I can stop myself any further.

Jess comes up to me and strokes my back. "Amadeus, it is but a small price to pay. Life is life. Whether our kind or not. War has been part of our genes for far too long. We've killed and they've killed for far too long. Think of it as saving the rest of humankind and not as slaughtering these bunch. They probably have it coming anyway. You have nothing to fear. We will come out of this alive as we have every time in the past."

She doesn't get it. My biggest fear is that I lose the human in me after this. She's known me for the longest time. Since we were kids. And yet, she doesn't understand me as I am today.

I give in to the anticipation. I've merely delayed the inevitable.

"Summon the Draconians and the Obsidians. I will lead the charge with them. Have the mages and archers fall back to defend the forest. Jess will handle things here. Marcus, you take the knights & the undying and flank their escape through the portal. The Aeolians will come to fear the name 'Amadeus Walker' and rue the day they rejected my proposal to bring peace to the valley."

I walk out of the tent with unwavering resolve in my eyes. My senses are acute and I perceive every aspect of the world around me. I hear Marcus heaving a sigh of relief. A tiny sigh. But nothing misses my perception. It is the reason why I've been able to come out of many life-death scenarios alive.

I look up at the sky. It's been ten years, Stevey. Forgive me for what I'm about to do. I know that revenge is not what you stood for. And I tried. I really did. It seems like the gods above are having me exact revenge for you. Funny how things turn out, huh?
