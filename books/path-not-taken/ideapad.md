# Path Not Taken

- Time Access Points - physically located points visible to the naked eye
- Start chapter with - the final jump
- The Van Schenanigans
- Perceieve time access points - because of some ability
- TAPs are located in your comfort zone (place - high school for protoganist)
- TAPs are there everywhere, but you can only perceive them in the school (for some reason)
- Accessing one makes that one disappear
- The end is about a path not taken?
- Transfer of consciousness - follows the rules of time travel
- Physically everything stays the same
- Its just information that gets transferred, and over time you lose the information naturally (no brain lesions or
 something like that)
- Unlike `Butterfly Effect`, you dont come back to the same point of time
- You never see the same TAP twice
