In the pristine moonlight, one could hear a low roar in the distant. A deserted grove of trees on the mountain side, overlooking an empty valley. The roar was steadily growing in volume. In the edge of the mountain, where a jagged peak jutted into the air above the valley, there sat a girl and a boy.

The girl was 17. At 6'3'' she was tall when compared to other girls her age. Even girls from the higher societies only averaged at about 6'1''. Considering her background, most people would be shocked when they saw her in her community. But despite her modest upbringing, she had the radiance of a fine young woman. Certainly, a diamond in the rough. She had a square face, skin the color of caramel, and purple hair pulled back into a ponytail. She had a tiny piercing at the bottom of her lip and a tatoo of the wings of a butterfly at the back of her neck. She wore black worn-out leggings, a blue t-shirt with a blackish-brown panelled leather jacket. The jacket was open and drifting in the wind as she looked up at the sky. It was a peacful night.

"He'll be here soon, won't he?", the boy asked.

"You can literally hear him coming. Who else do you think comes to this place in the middle of the night?", she replied.

"It could be anyone on that hover bike you know."

"Trust me Stevey, we've been coming here for quite a bit now. No one else even knows this place exists", she assured him.

Stevey glanced anxiously towards the sound. He was almost as tall as the girl. An inch or two shorter perhaps. Definitely around average for the guys he hung out with. At 16, he was the youngest of the gang. Growing up, he had been bullied in every foster home he was sent to. Over time, he picked up the knack of getting into any group with his social skills. He had a dry wit about him, that made him a fun guy to have around. This was his survival mechanism. He a round face, with googly eyes and the spectacles to match it. He had a hoodie over his white tshirt and he had it pulled up over his dirty blonde hair. He had trackpants of a very thin material on and he couldn't stop his teeth from chattering.

"Quit being such a wimp."

"I'm not. Your ice-cold bitchy attitude has me freezing over here. Care to lend me your jacket Jess?"

"Fuck off or I'll toss you over the edge shorty!"

"See, what did I tell you. A grade-A . . ."

"Don't you dare say it"

The roar of the distant hover bike had grown so that it almost sounded like it was just around the bend of the path leading out of there. As Jess looked at the bend, a hover bike swerved in between two trees and came into sight.
